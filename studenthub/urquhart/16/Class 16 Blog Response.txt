I really enjoyed reading this article! The idea of the "aura" exists for each piece in a museum, and this project allows the artist to have greater control of the emotions/thoughts their piece puts out, rather than leave everything up to the viewer. These AR techniques also allow for lesser-known artists to have their work preserved and more widely recognized; even without the losses from Hurricane Sandy, I wouldn't be surprised if most of the artists in the Westbeth have their work lost to time after their deaths. Using AR, meanwhile, presents their work to a wider audience; the Roman cubiculum overlaid with the puppeteer describing her own apartment is a great example. I also enjoyed the focus on ludonarrative and the interactions between the piece and the viewer. With the oracle figure, the experience is personalized for each type of guest, allowing them to understand the piece in a more digestible way.

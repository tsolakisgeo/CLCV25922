    <h1 class="gradient-text">How to be an Archaeologist</h1>
    <p1>For my final project, I thought it would be more fitting to create a website detailing
        the site, my finds from this summer, and the tools I used on my data. Hope you enjoy! </p1>
    <h2>History of Mt. Lykaion</h2>
    <p1>This section will talk about the history of Mt. Lykaion, the importance of Pausanias,
        and the work that got accomplished in previous seasons (you can read the first report
        <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2972/hesperia.83.4.0569">here!</a>)
        It will also set the context for Trench PP and explain why we're digging there in the first place. </p1>
    <h2>Trench PP 2022</h2>
    <p1>Start with the overhead map of the trench, followed by the imposed drone image, followed
        by the other sets of images (baskets and significant finds).</p1>
    <h2>3D Model of Baskets</h2>
    <p1>This section will detail the Python code I used to create a model in Blender detailing 
        the density of my baskets.</p1>

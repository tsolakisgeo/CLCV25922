    <h1 class="gradient-text">How to be an Archaeologist</h1>
    <p1>For my final project, I thought it would be more fitting to create a website detailing
        the site, my finds from this summer, and the tools I used on my data. Hope you enjoy! </p1>
    <h2 class="gradient-text">History of Mt. Lykaion</h2>
    <p1>Situated in the middle of the Peloponnese, Mt. Lykaion was an important sanctuary and hotbed of activity for ancient
        Arcadians. The mountain receives its name from the mythological King Lycaon, who was turned to a wolf by Zeus as punishment for feeding him human
        flesh—Book I of Ovid's Metamorphoses discusses the "lycanthropy" at great length. The earliest human activity is thought
        to be during the Mycenean age, as there is evidence for an ancient sanctuary at the mountain's ash altar. Nevertheless,
        Lykaion achieved its greatest prominence during the height of the Peloponnesian War; the Neda River flowed nearby, and Lykaion
        sat near the borders of Arcadia, Messinia, and Elis. The cult of Zeus Lykaios flourished in the Classical Era, and the famed Lykaian
        games were held at the Hippodrome—though not as important as its competition at Olympia, the winners of the Lykaian Games
        could take great pride in their achievements.</p1>
    <p2>The site is divided into two key areas. The <b>Upper Sanctuary</b>, at the top of the mountain, is the site of the ash altar
        and the ancient Temenos, where it was said that anyone bold enough to enter would die within the year. Meanwhile, the <b>Lower Sanctuary</b>
        —about 200 meters down-held the ancient Hippodrome, the Agno Fountain, and the Sanctuary of Pan. Even from the Lower Sanctuary, the view
        is remarkable, but on a clear day one can see all of the Peloponnesian peaks from the altar. </p2>
    <p3>Much of what we know about ancient Lykaion comes from the work of Pausanias, an ancient traveller living during the 2nd
        century CE. The mountain had lost its importance by the Roman ages, but Pausanias still writes with great reverence for
        the ancient customs that once defined the site. Pausanias is one of a few extant sources concerning Lykaian ritual, and
        his account proved vital for inspiring an excavation at the site.</p3>
    <p4>The first major excavations of Lykaion were led by Kourouniotis at the turn of the 20th century. He placed trenches by the 
        temenos and throughout the Lower Sanctuary, finding a swath of cultural material from the Classical Ages and beyond. 
        The current excavation, led by Dr. Romano and Dr. Voyatzis, was started in 2004 to expand on the earlier findings of 
        Kourouniotis, and in particular to learn more about the stadium and the ancient Lykaian games. The first report from
        the excavation is <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2972/hesperia.83.4.0569">here</a> on JSTOR.</p4>
    <h2>Trench PP</h2>
    <p1>The excavation opened Trench PP in 2016 to explore a "circular anomaly" that had been seen on Google Earth. The Sanctuary of Pan,
        as Pausanias had described it, was supposed to be within the Lower Sanctuary, but no location had been determined until the anomaly was
        discovered. In 2019, a painted inscription to Pan was found in the middle of the trench, giving backing to Pausanias' observations; the
        red-figure pottery found within the trench was also a valuable find. Our goal heading into the 2022 season was to look for more
        evidence in support of the Sanctuary, and to look for some kind of water structure that would have supported a grove of trees.</p1>
    <p2>The following images are all maps constructed in QGIS, using different kinds of layers and CSV files to illustrate what we found.</p2>

    </figure>
    <p3>Before I could start building my map, I needed to go through my data. Archaeologists keep both digital and physical records of everything they find, 
        but I was working off of digital PDFs of our scanned notebooks. I went through both notebooks, writing down elevation points for our significant finds 
        and screeshotting the added photos of them, and additionally keeping track of what we found in each basket. Once I had all my data, I created CSV files
        for my four layers, including a pathname column that linked the coordinate to the photo. I then began building my QGIS file.</p3>
    <p4>I started off by adding the latest Google Satellite data as a basemap. I created a new XYZ Layer, sourced the Satellite data from online,
        maximized my zoom level (as we were working within a small area), and established a new connection.</p4>
    <figure>

    </figure> 
    <p5>I then added the drone photo of the trench on top of the satellite imagery. I had to pick a coordinate that was approximately at the middle of the 
        drone photo, and make small changes if my placement was off (which I had to do for practically every CSV file, since the excavaton notebooks only 
        contained elevations for our baskets/finds). I rotated the photo to match the North orientation, and lowered the opacity.</p5>
    <p6>I then repeated that process for the photos of significant finds and the basket maps. For all three CSVs, I added a Raster Image Marker that used a
        linked photo to represent the coordinate. I was able to directly align the pathname column in each CSV with the Raster.</p6>
    <figure>

    </figure> 
    <p7>For the map of the density of cultural material finds, I used a marker that we had used in class with the Crete map: a Graduated marker. I created
        lots of classes based on the value in the Cultural Material column, and set a range of sizes for the markers depending on the Cultural Material value.</p7>
    <figure>
    <img src="QGIS Maps/Graduated Marker.jpg" alt="Graduated Marker" title="Graduated Marker" width="400" height="500">
    </figure>
    <p8>The main problem here was having to re-adjust the coordinates constantly to match up the photos. Thankfully, QGIS gives you coordinates if you right-click.</p8>
    <h2>Converting Coordinate Values to UTM Values</h2>
    <p1>GPS coordinate values are helpful for locating something on the Earth, but they aren't helpful when you want to work with a flat map, since
        the distance covered by degrees of longitude and latitude isn't constant (because of the Earth's curvature). UTM Coordinates, known as 
        Universal Transverse Mercator, keep a constant distance between coordinates, and allow points to be better represented on an XYZ axis.</p1>
    <p2>Please go to the Python file titled <b>Coordinate to UTM DataFrame Work</b> in the GitHub Folder. I have comments
        explaining the specific lines of code I wrote.</p2>
    <h2>Conclusions</h2>
    <p1>I wanted to create a project that shows how technology can aid the Classics, and I think I've been able to do that.
        QGIS makes it possible for archaeologists to visualize their findings and create different layers that illuminate what
        they've discovered; it's also possible for satellite imagery to inspire new discoveries, as it did for my trench. DataFrames,
        meanwhile, make it possible to deal with an overwhelming amount of numbers and to sort or convert them if another academic
        party should need their data for something else. My biggest takeaway from this project, however, is that Classicists need
        to place greater importance on technology in general. Archaeologists prioritize written notebooks above all else, which is easy
        to access if you have the physical copy, but it becomes a pain once you're dealing with fifty baskets and hundreds of elevation
        points, and you can't write a code to search them up. </p1>

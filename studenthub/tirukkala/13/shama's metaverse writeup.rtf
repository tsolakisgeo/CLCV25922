\f0\fs24 \cf0 The Metaverses tour that the four interdisciplinary artists created merged the objects at the Met, that would typically be separated from the time and place from which they were created, and allow viewers to view a part of that history in conjecture with the object. I thought it was also interesting how some objects facilitated interactions between the people on the tours, making each visit different depending on who they interacted it. It really made me think about how the dynamics of everything that occurs at the museum impacts how the viewer views that object and using modern technology can have a profound impact on how people view the time period and place in which the object exists at large. Using Aurasma to create an aura that was triggered by an image of the object was such a great idea and it definitely makes the object seem more like a part of its intended use, especially with the actors being a part of it.\

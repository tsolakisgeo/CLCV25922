\f0\fs24 \cf0 Spreadsheets are a powerful tool but the way they work often lends to them ending up with careless mistakes that can have massive ramifications (as it was in the case of the British government video). However, spreadsheets also allow people to have the ability to consolidate massive amounts of information very easily and in a reasonable manner. They also lend themselves to being coded easily which lets shortcuts happen quickly. On the other hand, spreadsheets are often coded carelessly which can lead to massive change in large amounts of information with little way to easily change it.}
